"we need fast parallel BFS, but dividing the work takes too much time and is really complicated. also we cannot easily schedule work to reduce message passing."
"this paper discusses a new technique to effiiciently and determinstically divide the work to be done for BFS across multiple processing elements."
"this work is evaluated using the MODEL model to accurately but succinctly characterize modern parallel processing architectures [CITE,CITE]"
"we show our technique is optimal under these conditions: (1) one, (2) two, and (3) three."
