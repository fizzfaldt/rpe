%TODO:
TODO "WRITE" these instead of what we have now.
\begin{verbatim}
Add labels and links for each of these
\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimize for false sharing
        \begin{itemize}
            \item From parallel Prefix Sum <- pretty easy, just set appropriate GRAIN-Size and align properly.
            \item For Dist array.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item can use radix sort for large levels where num degrees $= \Omega(n^c)$
                    \item Each proc can create an unsorted list of all cache lines its degrees touch, then each proc takes \#$cachelines /p$ cache lines
                \end{itemize}
            \item For find sublist
       \end{itemize}
   \item Optimize for cache-misses
   \item Make processor-oblivious
   \item Make cache-oblivious?  Is it already?
   \item Optimize $T_p,T_1,W_p$ for PRAM model
\end{itemize}
