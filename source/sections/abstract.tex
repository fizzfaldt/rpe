    We have developed a multithreaded implementation of breadth-first
    search (BFS) of arbitrary graphs using the Cilk++ extensions to C++.
    We analyze our FBFS algorithm under the CILK model, where synchronizing
    $n$ tasks takes $\Oh{\log n}$ time.  We introduce a lower bound for $T_P$ in
    level-synchronous BFS.
    FBFS achieves high work-efficiency by applying parallel prefix sum to split
    up all work at a given distance from a source vertex.

    FBFS algorithm deterministically matches the lower bound for $T_P$,
    is asymptotically optimal for $T_1$, and is scale-free.  FBFS saves energy by letting processors
    become idle whenever possible: total non-idle work among all $P$ processors is $\Oh{T_1}$.
    Our algorithm is non-deterministic in that it contains benign races which may affect
    performance (by up to a constant factor) but not its correctness.  These races can be
    fixed with mutual-exclusion locks which will slow down FBFS empirically.

    In particular, we show that for a graph $G=(V,E)$ with diameter $D$, FBFS runs
    in time $\Oh{(\size{V}+\size{E})/P + D\log P}$ on $P$ processors, which means
    that it attains near-perfect linear speedup if $P \ll (\size{V}+\size{E})/(D\log(\size{V}+\size{E}))$
